## Model-Calibration
# Overview
This repository focuses on model calibration in quantitative finance, using options as a primary application. Model calibration ensures that theoretical models align closely with observed market prices, particularly in option pricing and volatility estimation. This project employs a combination of optimization techniques to calibrate parameters in models such as the Black-Scholes, stochastic volatility, and local volatility models.

# Contents
Optimization Techniques: Overview of both deterministic and stochastic optimization methods such as Newton-Raphson, Nelder-Mead, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing.
Implied Volatility Calibration: Focus on the Black-Scholes model, implied volatility surfaces, and their interpolation and extrapolation techniques.
Model Risk and Regularization: Approaches to managing model risk, including statistical methods for regularization in non-parametric settings.
Examples of Calibrations: Practical applications demonstrating model calibration for rate curves and other asset classes.
# Key Features
Black-Scholes Implied Volatility Calibration: Calibration of implied volatility across different strikes and maturities to develop a volatility surface.
Stochastic and Local Volatility Models: Implementations of advanced volatility models, addressing the limitations of Black-Scholes for complex derivatives.
Optimization Methods: A toolkit of optimization algorithms tailored for parameter calibration in high-dimensional spaces, including both deterministic and stochastic approaches.
